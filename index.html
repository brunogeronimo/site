		<h2>A little bit about my career</h2>
		<h3>Companies that I've worked for</h3>
		<article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/EmployeeRole">
			<meta name="keywords" content="phá¹•, aws, integrations, pennacorp, magento, mercadolivre, brazil federal revenue, mysql, git, SVN, NF-e">
			
			<h2 itemprop="name">PHP Software Developer</h2>
			
			<h3>from <time itemprop="startDate" datetime="04-01-2014">January, 2014</time> to <time itemprop="endDate" datetime="2016-06-30">June, 2016</time></h3>
			
			<h4 itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Corporation">at <span itemprop="name">Pennacorp Systems</span> <a href="https://www.pennacorp.com.br/" itemprop="url" title="Pennacorp Systems" target="_blank">(site)</a></h4>
			
			<p itemprop="description">Pennacorp have an ERP system called <strong>Icarus</strong>. It is responsible to control everything related to all companies. Like: Stock control, invoices, customers, suppliers, carriers, employeers, and so on.</p>

			<p itemprop="description">I was responsible to give direct support to all customers with all kinds of questions. I was responsible to convert features from an old system to the newest, and also develop new features for it.</p>

			<p itemprop="description">One big creation that I've made working with them was an integration between Icarus and <a href="https://www.mercadolivre.com.br" title="Mercado Livre Website" target="_blank">Mercado Livre</a> (a marketplace similar to <a href="https://www.ebay.com" title="eBay Website" target="_blank">eBay</a>), which is responsible to stock, customers, listings and purchases synchronization. The manual work of <em>copying</em> and <em>pasting</em> information from both platforms is not necessary. Also, you have options to create, update and remove listings using all information available on the system, avoiding the manual work of writing it starting from zero by yourself. The same integration was also made with <a href="https://www.magento.com" title="Magento Website" target="_blank">Magento</a>.</p>

			<p itemprop="description">In Brazil, we must send eletronic invoices for every sale made. We do this through <a href="http://www.nfe.fazenda.gov.br/portal/principal.aspx" title="Brazil's NF-e Website" target="_blank">NF-e</a> interface. I was responsible to create this integration on <strong>Icarus</strong>. In order to do this, I had to implement cryptography to safely store customers' digital certificates, make the connection between the system and NF-e's interface and XML and DANFE generation.</p>
